# Documents Repo for Bioinformatics Courses

This repository is set up by Song Zikuo and will loyally record bioinfo courses and after-class exercises. It's available to anyone with the passion to learn bioinformatics.

Fortunatrly, at least in my point of view, you who come across upon this repo are to witness the process in which a totally __zero-based beginner__ has started his own voyage to a brand new sea of disciplines. As you can see, the repo is still too shallow and calls for further construction. Everyone is welcomed for __communication and idea exchanging__.

### At this very beginning stage, the repo will be made up of contants as follows:
- the notes of bioinfo courses given by Prof. Lu Zhi (maybe kind of personal and subjective)
- some thinkings over relative topics mentioned in the courses or met in life.
- reviews which come from paper-reading or discussion.
- collections of homework, which are solutions, codes and algorithms.
- classical algorithm examples
- and anything worthwhlie to be taken down

### Also, as the repo is being enriched, this README.md will also serve as the catalogue and a pre-reading guide. 

### Looking forward to the future.
